# burgerApp

Welcome to Brandon's Burgers

This is a restaurant app that allows users to place orders.

Upon submitting an order, the meal will appear on the page, waiting to be eaten.

Each meal has a 'Devour' button that will allow you to eat it, and move it to the bottom of the page.

This app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM to store and update orders in the database.

Thank's for stopping by!
